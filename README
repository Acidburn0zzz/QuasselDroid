QuasselDroid
============

Quassel is a distributed, decentralized IRC client, written using C++ and Qt.
QuasselDroid is a pure-java client for the Quassel core, allowing you to
connect to your Quassel core using your Android (TM) phone.

No requirements apart from a recently modern Android SDK (2.1 should be
sufficient, no guarantees in either directions, though).

It uses the following extra projects (though all support libraries are included
for your convenience):
    - Otto: http://square.github.com/otto/
    - Android Support Library: http://developer.android.com/tools/extras/support-library.html
    - Crittercism: https://www.crittercism.com/developers/docs-android


We do support encryption, but no compression support for now (qCompress should,
in theory, be compatible with Deflater if you do some pre-parsing massaging on
it, but I haven't gotten it to work just yet).
