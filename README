QuasselDroid
============

Quassel is a distributed, decentralized IRC client, written using C++ and Qt.
QuasselDroid is a pure-java client for the Quassel core, allowing you to
connect to your Quassel core using your Android (TM) phone.

No requirements apart from a recently modern Android SDK (2.1 should be
sufficient, no guarantees in either directions, though).

We do support encryption, but no compression support for now (qCompress should,
in theory, be compatible with Deflater if you do some pre-parsing massaging on
it, but I haven't gotten it to work just yet).
